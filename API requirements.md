In this week, you need develop a nodejs project that achieve the following feature:

The project should provide the following API.

If you have any question, please contact me. 

```json
Q and A system
   Description：The students ask system questions and get the answer
   Url：/ask_question/p1
   Type：POST
   Body：
   {
      "question":"string"
   }
   Response：
   {
      "type": "1",
      # The value could be 1，2，3。 
      # 1:Find the right answer，2: not sure，3: The sentense doesn't make any sense
      "question1":"question1",
      "question2":"question2",
      "question3":"question3",
      "answer1":"answer1",
      "answer2":"answer2",
      "answer3":"answer3"
      #The three questions and answers are the three most likely questions and answers（Probability 1 > 2 > 3）
   }
```

In developing process, you need to utlize the similarity rate API that 

```json
Similarity rate
	Descirption: Get the similarity rate 1:n
	Url: https://alistempirefoundation.org:5041/test
	Type: POST
	Body:
	{
	"s1":"sentence" #user input
	"s2":["sentense1","sentense2","sentense3"] #input all the possible sentenses to calculate the similarity rate
	}
	Response:
	{
	"rate": [“0.1”,"0.2","0.3"]
	}
```

For now, all the questions and answers are here.
